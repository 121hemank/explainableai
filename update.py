# Extending ExplainableAI to Support Regression Models
# To extend the ExplainableAI package to support regression models, we need to make the following changes:

# 1. Update the Model Interface
# The current model interface is designed to work with classification models. We need to modify it to accommodate regression models. This can be done by adding a new method to the interface that returns the predicted values for regression models.

# python


class ModelInterface:
    def predict_proba(self, X):
        # Returns the predicted probabilities for classification models
        pass

    def predict(self, X):
        # Returns the predicted values for regression models
        pass
# 2. Implement Regression Model Support
# We need to update the existing implementation to support regression models. This involves modifying the explain method to handle regression models.

# python


def explain(model, X, y, **kwargs):
    if isinstance(model, RegressionModel):
        # Handle regression models
        pass
    else:
        # Handle classification models
        pass
# 3. Add Regression Model Classes
# We need to add new classes for regression models that implement the updated model interface.

# python


class RegressionModel(ModelInterface):
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model

    def predict(self, X):
        # Returns the predicted values for regression models
        return self.model.predict(X)
# 4. Update the Explanation Algorithms
# We need to update the explanation algorithms to support regression models. This involves modifying the algorithms to handle the predicted values returned by regression models.

# python


def lime_explain(model, X, y, **kwargs):
    if isinstance(model, RegressionModel):
        # Handle regression models
        pass
    else:
        # Handle classification models
        pass
# By making these changes, we can extend the ExplainableAI package to support regression models.
